#json file => facebok_accounts.json
#FOR FACEBOOK PAGES
- Every facebook page will have their own access token and needs to be used to get post and 
comments. 
- we get me/accounts which generates access token for all the pages 
saves id, name and access token in json file 
- loop through the json file and get longlived access token for all the pages 
and save the token back to json files 


# json file => ad_accounts.json
#FOR FACEBOOK AD ACCOUNTS
- This logic will workon smart solution ad accounts only 
Smart solution ad account works on single access token which have create a long lived access token


Flow of the project
- Store all the campaign ads name and Id in the json file for ad accounts 
- loop through all the ad campaings and check for all the ads with comment (get first 100 comments and negative comment)
- save the new negative comments in a seperate list just like sending emails automation 
- also save the time comment was posted in the json file

- create a login to loop through both the files and check for new negative comments
- send email with links to the list of negative email list
